# Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms
__Nathan Kurien - zdac117 - CS3821 Final Project__

This repository will contain my Final Year Project. Currently the project is undergoing the planning and initial development phase.

My project will be to implement various multiple machine learning algorithms, such as KNN and Decision Trees, and compare their performance.


__The structure can be described as follows:__

### diary
This directory will contain my project diary and personal notes as I work through my project this year.

### project_plan_draft
This directory contains my current project plan draft which will outline how I intend to tackle my project. This will likely contain LaTeX source material. I will likely create a reports directory to combine this directory with future reports.
