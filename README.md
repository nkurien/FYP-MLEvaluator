# Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms
__Nathan Kurien - zdac117 - CS3821 Final Project__

This repository will contain my Final Year Project. Currently the project is undergoing the initial development phase, with proof-of-concept programs and early reports.

My project will be to implement various multiple machine learning algorithms, such as KNN and Decision Trees, and compare their performance.

__The structure can be described as follows:__

### diary
This directory folder will contain my project diary and personal notes as I work through my project this year.

### poc
This directory folder contains my proof of concept programs that will act as the foundation of my project development.

### reports
This directory folder will contain the reports made or in progress, including my project plan, my interim report and my supplementary reports on the algorithms being evaluated.

### research
This directory folder contains all material I've found useful with researching the theory and tools behind this project. I've kept useful resources here for my own reference.
