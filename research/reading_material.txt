The purpose of this document is mostly for self-reference, so I can find resources corresponding the specific research easily. It also serves as a way for me to show where I'm researching from.

Borrowed Physical Books from library
1) The Elements of Statistical Learning, 2nd Edition. (TEoSL) Trevor Hastie, et al. 2009
  - Main reference book for theory, it just has everything
  - Somewhat verbose, but excellent examples given. Notation seems heavy for now.
  - Chapter 2 (pg 9 - 41): Overview of Supervised Learning
    - Least Squares, Nearest Neighbour, curse of dimensionality, kernel methods. This chapter alone covers an immense amount of theory that will be useful in breaking down the algorithms themselves
  - Chapter 7 (pg 219 - 259): Model Assessment and Selection
    - This chapter will help with understanding what's involved with analysing algorithm perfomance. Bias, variance and complexity are explored here.
    - Cross-Validation (7.10. pg 241) - section will likely be very relevant.
2) Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Bishop. 
3) Foundations of Machine Learning by Mohri
4) Introduction to Machine Learning with Python by Muller & Guido
5) Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow
6) Machine Learning by Tom M. Mitchell. 1997.
  Also here: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/files/MachineLearningTomMitchell.pdf
  - Chapter 5 (pg 128 - 153): Really great chapter on model performance metrics
  I think this book is generally more helpful for Classification models

Digital books:
1) An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python
  - new book! Not gone through yet but will likely be very useful, as it's supposed to be a simpler version of TEoSL.

  https://neptune.ai/blog/how-to-compare-machine-learning-models-and-algorithms - Comparing ML algorithms (seems more practically-focused than the books) would need to apply methods that correspond with algorithms I pick.
