# Supervisor Meeting 1

[Meeting Audio](https://recorder.google.com/ebbb4a8c-81e4-4e05-8175-30ba2e659e5f) - Recorded with Zhiyuanâ€™s permission

25/09/23 11am - Prof. Luo

02:30 - 05:30 - Nearest Neighbour algorithm - keep it simple

05:30 - 05:45 - Logistic Regression

06:30 - 07:00 - NN and DTs done before Christmas

    Reports + Software implementation done together

07:00 - 08:00 - Jupyter Notebooks are enough, GUI is a secondary priority

08:00 - 08:30 - Datasets - UCI repository

    Iris dataset is useful for classification

08:45 - Data preprocessing 

    Normalisation is important for KNN

10:00 - Playing with k-neighbours

    Once basics are done, start increasing K as progress is made

10:50 - Performance measures

    For classification - accuracy is good

11:15 - Report for metrics and measures?

    Donâ€™t get too lost in theory - the aim is to focus on deliverables and show an end product on the algorithms

11:50 - Model evaluation

    Hold out test set, Cross-validation, k-folds

    Using only one test set might just be â€˜luckâ€™.

12:30 - try on different parts of data

13:00 - Python Library Use

    Should really start without using libraries when implementing algorithms

    Library use should be Plan B, not Plan A

13:50 - Risk and Mitigation - Libraries are a possible mitigation

14:15 - Software Engineering aspect of the project

    Data Structures

    Make sure algorithm can run on large datasets

14:45 - TDD? - ML is just a function, can test on simple inputs and outputs

15:20 - Start on paper with simple calculations, understand each and every step

15:40 - Mathematical notation

    itâ€™s not complicated ðŸ˜…

    Should be okay with NN

    Decision Trees - understand purity, Gini Impurity and its applications

17:55 - Repo use

    Itâ€™s a useful backup

    Only need to use once a week, not everyday 

    Repo use is fine for now

    Good practice for working in industry

19:15 - Programming and Reports hand-in-hand

19:55 - Availability

    Send an email, canâ€™t promise

20:40 - Project Plan

    The purpose of it is to help the student in the first place, and think about the projectâ€™s delivery

21:05 - As you start making deadlines, itâ€™ll become clearer if Iâ€™ve taken on too much

21:50 - First assignment on ML is on Nearest Neighbours

22:30 - plan is just a plan, if you donâ€™t deliver itâ€™s pointless

23:15 - A lot to expand on if Iâ€™m comfortable

24:10 - Think about the SE techniques when implementing, particularly the data structures

24:30 - Local machine? - Gets complicated once a million datasets are involved

25:30 - Happy to look at Project Plan

26:00 - Do as much as I can before deadlines get heavy
