\section{Abstract}
% Your abstract goes here.
% Provide an overview of the aims and objectives for the project.

Machine learning (ML) has taken the world by storm in recent times. In the era of unprecedented data generation, ML has emerged as a pivotal technology with profound implications for industries and everyday life. Its ability to extract meaningful patterns from vast datasets has revolutionized decision-making processes and enhanced automation across diverse sectors.\par
Supervised Learning algorithms exist to solve regression and classification tasks, and this project will focus primarily on classification. Within the ML landscape, classification algorithms play a critical role in tasks such as image recognition, spam filtering, medical diagnosis, and more. /par




\section{Milestones}
\subsection{First Term}
\subsubsection{Reports}
% Describe the milestones for the first term, including reports.
Report 1: Nearest Neighbour Algorithms - In this report I hope to discuss the theory behind nearest neighbour algorithms, 1-Nearest Neighbour and K-Nearest Neighbour, and further details behind how they function. \par 
Report 2: Decision Tree Algorithms - In this report I hope the discuss the theory behind the Decision Tree algorithm and explore its measures of uniformity. \par
(Extensions on metrics and SVMs) Ensemble Learning? Kernel Methods?
